We work with the Northwind Traders database. The database records all sales transactions and deliveries of goods produced by the company to its customers.

The database contains the following detailed information:
1. Northwind Traders customers who buy goods from the company (customers table)
2. Information about the goods that the company trades (table products)
3. Groups / categories of goods (categories table)
4. Northwind Traders employee details (employees table)
5. Information about carriers that deliver goods to end customers (shippers table)
6. Information on contracts / orders (orders table)
7. Detailed information on contracts / orders (table order_details)

The case:
The company decided to abandon its own production and purchase goods from suppliers. Information has been collected on suppliers who are ready to supply the goods on which the business of Northwind Traders is built. Some suppliers are willing to supply several types of products, but the company decided to exclude the situation when one product is supplied by different suppliers.
